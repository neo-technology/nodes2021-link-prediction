This repository contains datafiles, ingestion scripts and cypher scripts
that were used to run two link prediction demos on Nodes 2021 conference, presented by Alicia Frame and Jacob Sznajdman.

The ingestion scripts can be run for example against a local neo4j database.
Optionally, the neo4j-admin tool and the push-to-cloud tools can be used to transfer the data to an Aura instance.

The demo was run on Neo4j 4.2 with GDS 1.6.0-alpha06.
